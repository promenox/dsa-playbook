# The Data Structures & Algos Playbook
I needed a better way to study DSA. This guide is my attempt to cut noise.  

## Written Guide
The dsa-playbook is my personal logbook of ideas. A guide of implementation is [accessible here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bOqdAuzw33F0etx2T_SikiQQF-7Pi8Id_x5f5dGEZII/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.6cyicw9st8b5).
